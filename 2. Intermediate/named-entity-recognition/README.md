# Named-Entity-Recognition

Welcome to the **Named Entity Recognition** project! In this project, we'll implement a named entity recognizer using Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) and the Viterbi algorithm. Named entity recognition (NER) is a fundamental task in natural language processing that involves identifying named entities (such as persons, organizations, locations, etc.) in text. By recognizing named entities, we can extract valuable information for downstream NLP tasks such as information retrieval, question answering, and document summarization.

## Key Techniques ðŸ”§

- **Conditional Random Fields (CRFs)** ðŸ¤«: Discriminative models for labeling sequences of observations.
- **Viterbi Algorithm** ðŸ§®: Dynamic programming algorithm for finding the most likely sequence of labels.
