# Sentiment Analysis with RNNs, LSTMs, GRUs, and CNNs 📈

Welcome to the **Sentiment Analysis** project! In this project, we’ll perform sentiment analysis on the IMDb dataset using various deep learning models. Sentiment analysis involves predicting whether a given piece of text expresses a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. We will explore different neural network architectures,

**including:**

- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
- Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs)
- Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs)
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Bidirectional Versions of RNNs, LSTMs, and GRUs

By comparing these models, we'll gain insights into how different architectures handle sentiment analysis tasks and which ones perform better on this dataset.

## Notebook on Kaggle 📝

The hands-on notebook for this project is available on Kaggle. You can access it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/oyounis/rnn-lstm-gru-cnn-sentiment-analysis).

## Dataset 📚

**IMDb Dataset:** A large movie review dataset containing labeled data for sentiment classification (positive or negative). This dataset is imported using the datasets library, making it easy to work with.

## Key Techniques 🔧

- **RNNs, LSTMs, GRUs, and CNNs:** These are fundamental neural network architectures that are effective for processing sequential data like text. We'll implement and compare them using PyTorch.
- **Bidirectional Models:** These models consider context from both the past and future, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the text.
- **PyTorch:** A powerful deep learning library used to build and train the models.
