# Part-Of-Speech Tagging

Welcome to the **Part-of-Speech Tagging** project! In this project, we'll implement a part-of-speech (POS) tagger using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and the Viterbi algorithm. POS tagging is a fundamental task in natural language processing that involves assigning a grammatical category (such as noun, verb, adjective, etc.) to each word in a sentence. By understanding the syntactic structure of text, we can extract valuable information for downstream NLP tasks such as named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, and machine translation.

## Key Techniques ðŸ”§

- **Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)** ðŸ¤«: Probabilistic models for sequences of observations and hidden states.
- **Viterbi Algorithm** ðŸ§®: Dynamic programming algorithm for finding the most likely sequence of hidden states.
