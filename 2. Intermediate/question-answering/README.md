# Question-Anwering (Heuristic-based)

Welcome to the **Question-Anwering** project! In this project, we'll create a simple question answering system using a heuristic approach. Given a question and a context, the system will generate an answer by selecting the sentence from the context that is most similar to the question.

## Key Techniques 🔧

- **Heuristic Search** 🕵️‍♂️: Rule-based approach for finding the best answer sentence.
- **Text Similarity** 📏: Measure of how similar two pieces of text are.
