## Key Techniques 🔧

- **Data Loading and Preprocessing** 📂: Load and preprocess the IMDb dataset.
- **Feature Extraction** 🎛️: Convert text data into numerical features using TF-IDF, BOW.
- **Model Building** 🏗️: Build a text classification model using Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes.
- **Model Evaluation** 📊: Evaluate the model's performance using accuracy and F1 score.
